How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

47)no the balance does not change after the error message.
48)now that the condition is that amount is greater or equal to 0 the program takes 0 as a valid amount
50)the effect in figures project with circle was visible and invisible which uses true or false condition which is perfect for it.
51)in the naive ticketmachine the money inserted will be lost and doesnt matter the amount of money you enter the machine will print the ticket.
    in the better ticket machine we have a condition which checks the price with the money inserted and when printed
    will add the money to the total and remove that amount from balance which makes sure that the extra money will stay in the balance and if you did not 
    enter enough money in the machine it will show an error message.
